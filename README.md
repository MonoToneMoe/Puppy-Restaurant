// Puppy Restaurant

// Description: Based off a prototype file, we constructed the front-end elements of a restaurant ran by puppies for puppies

// Review: 
- Footer text not supposed to be bolded
- Menu text is way too small inside the menu. The break lines between the items are supposed to be solid and red as well. There is a color palette on the adobexD.
- When Menu is shrunk to one column there is an offset that makes them unaligned. This could be fixed by taking the row out after a certain size is met since each menu item will sit in its own column
- Catering Text is a little jarring when shrunk to mobile. (might not be fixable due to the large amount of text)
- Photos should not have a gray ring on the border
